## 👋 Hello, I'm Deshawn

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a first-year Software Engineering student at Anglia Ruskin University with a strong passion for programming and building meaningful, creative solutions. I don’t tie myself to a single language — instead, I enjoy exploring different technologies and learning how they work by creating projects that solve real-world problems (or just bring a little fun!).

I’ve worked with clients to develop games, custom tools like converters and slot machines, and also provided support in fixing existing codebase issues. I love diving into projects that challenge me to think differently and push my technical understanding forward.

Currently, I’m planning on a large-scale AES-encryption smart camera system using Raspberry Pis and Flask for the user interface. It will include features like:

- Device-to-device communication

- Real-time push notifications

- A custom HTTPS server

- Sensor integration (heat + microphone)

- Web and mobile access

This project is also teaching me low-level networking, including TCP communications and performance optimization.

Beyond code, I enjoy helping other students who are new to programming, especially those struggling with concepts I once found difficult myself. I believe in sharing knowledge and lifting others up — it's one of the best parts of the learning journey.

### 🌱 My Goals:
- Land a placement where I can make a real impact

- Keep refining my code quality and architecture

- Build innovative projects that solve real problems

- Share my skills and collaborate with like-minded creators

### 💼 What I Do

- 📚 Continuously learning new technologies, languages, and development best practices  
- 🛠️ Building **side projects** to explore new ideas and deepen my understanding  
- 🤝 Freelancing for clients and delivering practical, real-world solutions  
- 🌐 Collaborating with students from **different universities** on group projects and innovations  
- 👨‍🏫 Teaching **beginner programming** concepts to new students who need extra support or want deeper insight  
- 💡 Passionate about sharing knowledge and helping others grow in their tech journey
